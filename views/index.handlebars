    <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia and is NOT a normal part of aging. It is a
        neurodegenerative disease, which means that it progressively gets worse over time. Once the disease
        damages the brain, it is very difficult to overcome the loss of memory and mental function. Early
        diagnosis and intervention is needed to improve quality of life and either slow or halt the course
        of the disease. Researchers are trying to understand the causes and early signs of Alzheimer’s
        disease.</p>
    <p>The Wake Forest School of Medicine Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) focuses on research,
        education and potential treatments aimed at preventing or slowing Alzheimer’s disease. Our ADRC has
        a special focus on early intervention and understanding the role of disorders such as hypertension
        and diabetes in Alzheimer’s disease. We also work to increase clinical study enrollment of people
        who are at increased risk and not adequately represented in clinical research. The Center benefits
        our region by providing education to health professionals, researchers, clinical study participants
        and their families, and the community at large.</p>
